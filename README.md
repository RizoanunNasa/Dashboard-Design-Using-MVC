## Overview
This project is a web-based dashboard built using the ASP.NET MVC framework. The application provides a modern, responsive interface to manage users, track key metrics, and visualize reports through charts. It includes several functionalities such as CRUD operations for user management, real-time data updates, and a dynamic UI that is optimized for both desktop and mobile devices.

The dashboard uses Chart.js (or any other library you choose) for data visualization and includes responsive design principles to ensure usability across various devices.

## Features
1. Dashboard Summary Section
Displays key metrics such as:
Total number of users.
Recent activities and events.
Provides a quick overview of the systemâ€™s current state.
2. User Management Section
Allows for CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for managing user accounts.
Provides an interface to view, add, edit, or remove users from the system.
3. Data Visualization Section
Displays interactive charts or reports using Chart.js or other chosen libraries.
Visualizes various system data such as user statistics or activity reports.
4. Responsive Design
Ensures that the dashboard is usable on a variety of devices, including desktops, tablets, and mobile phones.
The layout adjusts to fit screen sizes seamlessly.
5. Grid-based Data Loading
Loads data dynamically in grid-based formats, which allows users to manage and visualize large datasets efficiently.
The data is loaded from a database and rendered in a user-friendly table or grid.
6. Real-time Auto-update
Implements auto-update functionality, ensuring that the data on the dashboard reflects changes in real time without needing to reload the page.
7. Concurrency Handling
The system is designed to handle multiple users concurrently, allowing various users to interact with the dashboard at the same time without issues.
8. Database Script
The necessary database script has been provided to create the required tables for user management and dashboard data.
Make sure to run the database script to set up the required tables and relationships.
